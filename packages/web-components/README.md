# @digdir/designsystemet-web-components

Web component implementation of the Designsystemet components

- Uses `@digdir/designsystemet-theme` and `@digdir/designsystemet-css` for styling.
- Most components extend and behave as native html-elements.
- In development, so not all components from the react package are available

No documentation on getting started (yet). 

See package.json script "dev-build" for how its built, and /src for the available components
