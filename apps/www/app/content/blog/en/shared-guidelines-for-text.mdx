Part of ensuring consistent and recognizable user experiences across agencies is agreeing on best practices for text in digital services. A cross-agency working group is well underway with this work, and the guidelines will become part of Designsystemet.

The collaboration has been ongoing throughout 2025. The goal is to improve all users’ experiences with text in the interfaces of public digital services. By making these guidelines part of Designsystemet, everyone working on developing products and services in the public sector will have a single source of truth to turn to when they need advice on text in components.

## Content designers from several agencies
The working group consists of content and UX designers from Norsk helsenett, Skatteetaten, Lånekassen, NAV, Oslo Origo, KS, and Digdir. So far, the group has been divided into two teams, meeting monthly to work on guidelines for one component at a time. The guidelines will be published on Designsystemet’s website, making them easily accessible for everyone developing services.

## Shared guidelines for text in components
Language and terminology are often a key barrier to understanding digital services. Even small word choices can determine whether a user understands what is happening or becomes uncertain and stuck. Users of public digital services encounter many of the same interaction elements across services and providers. That makes it important to use language consistently—so that button labels, links, and error messages feel familiar and provide reliable support no matter which service the user is interacting with.

## How the project group works
The group builds on existing guidelines from various agencies, including [recommendations published by KS](https://www.ks.no/fagomrader/digitalisering/digital-kompetanse/klart-sprak-i-digitale-selvbetjeningslosninger/) and those already available in Designsystemet. We also look to other national and international sources, such as gov.uk and the Danish design system.

Since this work is done in addition to participants’ other responsibilities, progress is necessarily gradual, but thorough. Components and guidelines evolve constantly, so the group must keep track of new developments in visual design that affect text elements.

The initiative is led by Digdir and KS and is run on a “dugnad” basis—a collective effort alongside other duties. With highly experienced people involved, the collaboration has worked smoothly, and the group has agreed to continue into 2026. More agencies may also join the effort.
