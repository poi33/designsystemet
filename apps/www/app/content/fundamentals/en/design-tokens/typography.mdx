To present text correctly, styles have been created with different combinations of size, font weight, and line height. A set of typography components has also been created that encapsulate these styles, making them easy to use in different contexts. A description of how typography components are used can be found in the component article [Typography](https://storybook.designsystemet.no/?path=/docs/komponenter-typography--docs).

## Font-family

Font-family is not part of the library in Designsystemet; you must import the desired font in your app. The components have only been tested with the "Inter" font. If you choose a different font, you need to test that it looks good yourself.

Inter is a font specifically designed for good readability on computer screens. It meets the following criteria:

- [Open font license](https://github.com/rsms/inter/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) + has an [active community](https://github.com/rsms/inter)
- Large font family (light, regular, italic, bold, semibold)
- Recognizable letters, numbers, and special characters (not too creative)
- Clear ascenders and descenders on the letters
- Visible difference between similar characters (I, l, 1) (must be activated)
- Open letters don't close up (e.g., characters like a, e, and c)
- Consistent stroke thickness in transitions
- Tabular numbers ([monospace](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/introducing_type/understanding_numerals))
- [Variable font](https://rsms.me/inter/#variable)
- Good letter and word spacing
- Language support

The font is available in Figma without needing to download and install it yourself. If you need it for other purposes, you can download it from [github.com/rsms/inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/tag/v3.19).

For hosting, the Altinn CDN can be used:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://altinncdn.no/fonts/inter/v4.1/inter.css"

  crossorigin="anonymous"
/>
```

### Enable tail on lowercase "l"
Inter uses a lowercase "l" without a tail by default. This can be confused with an uppercase "I". To improve readability and avoid confusion, we recommend enabling a tail on the lowercase "l". Add the following to your CSS to enable it:

```css
font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
font-feature-settings: 'cv05' 1; /* Enable lowercase l with tail */
```
