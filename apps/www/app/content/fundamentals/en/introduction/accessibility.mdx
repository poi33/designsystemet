Designsystemet should be accessible to everyone, regardless of permanent or temporary reduced abilities.

Accessibility is an integral part of the development process—from the moment we start specifying a component to when it goes into production. If we discover issues that affect a component’s compliance with universal design, these will be prioritized by the core team. All components must meet the [legal requirements for universal design in the public sector](https://www.uutilsynet.no/regelverk/gjeldende-regelverk-og-krav/746).

Accessible components are just one part of creating accessible solutions. We will therefore also create guides and other aids so that teams get extra support to use the components for their intended purposes.

Under [Best Practices - Accessibility](/en/best-practices#accessibility), we will publish articles about how we can make our solutions as accessible as possible.
