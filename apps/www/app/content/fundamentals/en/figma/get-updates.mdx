What do you do when there's a new version of the [Figma community file](https://www.figma.com/@designsystemet)?

Figma currently [does not support retrieving changes from a Community file](https://forum.figma.com/t/need-a-way-to-get-latest-updates-or-subscribe-to-changes-from-a-published-community-file/32571). 

The Figma file you have in your organization is a copy without a connection to the main file. You can choose to make changes to this and adapt it to your organization before publishing it to the rest of the organization. 

When changes come to the Community file, you must decide for yourself if and when you want to update your own version. New components can be copied directly into your file. If there have been updates to existing components, it's possible to use the "Swap" function in Figma to replace a component with a new version. Here you need to consider whether it's best to delete the old component and add a new one, so that people who have used the component don't risk losing their content.
