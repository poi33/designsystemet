## Component Sizes

Most components in Designsystemet come in three recommended sizes: `Small`, `Medium`, and `Large` (`sm, md, lg`). 
These are developed to adapt to different needs across screen sizes and use cases.

`Small` is ideal for compact interfaces where space utilization is important, such as on mobile devices, expert tools, or administrative interfaces. 
It is recommended to use this size on websites with a base font of 16px.

`Medium` serves as the standard for most common use cases, and is recommended to use with a base font of 18px. 
This size provides a good balance between readability and space utilization and is particularly well-suited for desktop interfaces and larger display surfaces.

`Large` provides increased readability and clarity. It can be used in desktop interfaces or when visibility and accessibility are important. It can also be used in a defined context on the page to highlight key elements. 
It is recommended to use this size with a base font of 21px.

Components within a specific size are designed to work together. 
For example, many `medium` components have a height of 48px and a base font of 18px, which ensures a harmonious visual balance when placed next to each other.

To maintain a coherent and clear design, it is recommended to use fixed sizes within a given website or context. 
Many different combinations of sizes can lead to a cluttered and confusing design.

In some cases, components of different sizes can be combined to create better visual hierarchies and user-friendliness. 
In the example above, the search field section is larger and more prominent than the components in the header, because the search function is a central part of the page. 
The increased size makes it more visible and easily accessible to the user.
