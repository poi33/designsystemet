Follow these steps to ensure a smooth and consistent release process.
# Release 

We currently use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) and [Changeset bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) for tracking changes, generating changelogs, and publishing releases.


## 1. Publish new package version

### ⚠️ Precondition

***Make sure there are not changeset for `private:true` or `ignored` packages/apps as this will break changesets publish.***
You will get a `Error: Validation Failed: {"resource":"PullRequest","code":"custom","message":"No commits between main and changeset-release/main"}` error in the Github action.

### Steps 

- [Changeset bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) should pickup changesets (inside `.changeset/`) and generate a PR with bumped version and changelog.

- Approve and merge the PR.

- [Changeset bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) will now publish new a package version to npmjs and create [github releases](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/releases)

- Verify that new version is available in [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@digdir/designsystemet) (under `latest` tag) and on [github releases](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/releases)

## 2. Deploy new application version to production

- Manually trigger the github action deployment to `production` environment from `main` branch: 
  - [Deploy www](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/actions/workflows/deploy-www.yml)
  - [Deploy Theme](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/actions/workflows/deploy-theme.yml)
  - [Deploy Storybook](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/actions/workflows/deploy-storybook.yml)


# **Next**

When working on new changes we have two ways for testing downstream, choose one depending on features and development needs.

1. Manually trigger [Release Snapshot](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/actions/workflows/release-snapshot.yml) to publish new version for testing on (`test` or `next`).
2. Use [Changesets prerelease mode](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/prereleases.md)
 
# Patching older versions
Backporting a fix to an earlier version is rarely necessary and should generally be avoided. However, if required, the following steps outline how to proceed.

## Backporting Workflow
Say we have released `1.1.0` and `2.0.0` on main, and we want to backport a patch to the 1.1.x version.

### 1. Checkout the target version
`git checkout tags/v1.1.0`

### 2. Create a branch for the backport

For clarity, name the branch after the current tagged versions on the form `backport/major.minor.x`.
`git checkout -b backport/1.1.x`

### 3. Apply the fix

Apply your changes by cherry-picking from the future or make new commits. Commits added can only be `fix`, `chore`, or `docs`.
This ensures that the backport triggers a patch release and avoids any unintended major or minor version bumps.

### 4. Generate changeset

`pnpm changeset`

Verify that Changesets has made a patch release!

### 5. Push

`git push origin backport/1.1.x`

### 6. Trigger the release workflow

Manually trigger the [Release workflow](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/actions/workflows/release.yml) on your branch, (`backport/1.1.x` in this example).

### 7. Continue making patches, if needed

You can continue to work on the branch if you need to make new patches to 1.1.x.


## Should I merge the backport into main?
Usually not. Backported fixes are meant for older versions and might be incompatible with main (which may already have breaking changes). Instead:

- Ensure the original fix exists in main before backporting.
- If main is missing the fix, apply it separately in a way that aligns with new changes.
