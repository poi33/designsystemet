These are the values we want Designsystemet to be built upon:

## Quality

Designsystemet should maintain high quality and make it efficient to create digital products with good quality. By good quality, we mean something that provides a good user experience and has a solid technical foundation. All components should fulfill legal requirements, such as universal design. What we create should be [accessible](/en/fundamentals/introduction/accessibility) and provide a good user experience for everyone, regardless of permanent or temporary reduced abilities.

## Cohesiveness

The goal of Designsystemet is to support more cohesive and consistent user experiences across the public sector. When solutions are built on the same foundational building blocks, they create greater predictability for users. In addition to reusable components, we should collaborate to establish recognizable patterns across services. These patterns should demonstrate how to handle the most common user tasks and interactions. By using established conventions that citizens recognize across platforms, we can make digital services more intuitive and help reduce digital exclusion.

## Collaboration and openness

Designsystemet is based on a philosophy of collaboration, and it is desirable that it is developed in cooperation between agencies. It should be easy for anyone to get involved with contributions and input. We share everything we do openly - [source code](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet), [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/digdir/projects/3/views/1), [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/digdir/projects/3/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=19744450), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/@designsystemet), [Storybook](https://storybook.designsystemet.no), and [documentation](https://www.designsystemet.no/en).

We want to shape Designsystemet together so it remains flexible and usable across many contexts. All input, insights, arguments, and contributions are welcome. If a contribution leads to a better solution, it should be easy to make that change.

## Design and developer experience

It should be easy for other developers and designers to use and implement changes in Designsystemet and its components. It should be simple to find components, understand what a component does, and when it should be used. If there are challenges related to a component, this should be made visible and documented. It should be easy and predictable to navigate the technical solution.

## Trust

Designsystemet should handle challenges and changes in a safe and good way so that it achieves high trust among users. Users of Designsystemet should be able to trust that components don't stop working and that they behave as expected. Users of Designsystemet must be able to trust that Designsystemet is well taken care of and updated according to new requirements and needs that arise. We aim for mutual trust - trust in contributors is also important.
