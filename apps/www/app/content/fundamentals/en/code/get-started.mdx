Looking to get started with Designsystemet as a developer? Our [GitHub README](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet#table-of-contents) contains everything you need â€” including installation, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

To understand how colors, spacing, and typography are handled in code, we also recommend reading about [design tokens](/en/fundamentals/design-tokens/design-tokens).
