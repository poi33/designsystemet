Designsystemet offers foundational components that meet the [WCAG requirements included in Norwegian legislation](https://www.uutilsynet.no/wcag-standarden/wcag-standarden/86). It also provides guidance and recommendations that go beyond legal requirements, to help make digital solutions as user-friendly as possible for everyone—regardless of permanent or temporary impairments.

Accessibility often requires detailed technical and design considerations. Many components need specific HTML and ARIA attributes, proper focus handling, and dynamic announcements for screen readers. It’s also important to consider how different screen readers and browsers interpret combinations of attributes and elements. These are complex challenges that no individual developer or designer should have to solve alone. When we solve them together once, everyone can reuse the result. Any issues or improvements that are discovered can be addressed and benefit everyone using Designsystemet.

Accessibility is a part of our entire development process—from the moment we define a component until it is in production. If we discover any issues or limitations that affect a component’s accessibility, the team will prioritize fixing them.

Accessible components are only one part of creating accessible solutions. That’s why we also provide guides and other resources to support teams in using the components as intended.

Under [Best practices – Accessibility](/en/best-practices), we will publish articles about how we can make our solutions as accessible as possible.
